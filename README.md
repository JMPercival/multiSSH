# multiSSH
Used to create an ssh or sftp session across multiple servers to be able to run commands or get/push files across multiple systems at the same time.

Originally created with the need to run commands accross 10+ linux servers for a competition. This program needs to be extended to allow a person to create profiles of servers they would like to add or remove. For right now it is only tailored for the competition.
